#Questions answered

#can we assume people decided not to claim who are past x years old -- Assume anyone who hasn't claimed is still active
#do we assume every customer that did not report a claim is stilll an active customer?  --yes
#look at life in system by policy type -- there is no difference by policy type

#Questions unanswered
#Can you predict the people that will claim more than one policy? 

#interesting findings
# People who commit fraud (make multiple coverage changes the same day), their time between transactions
# follow a different distribution than people who dont make multiple changes the same day
# This fact gives us the ability to predict the people who will be fraudsters or people who take advantage
# of a missing company regulation.

#there is essentially no correlation between number of transactions and the length of policy


#can you predict amount paid out??
#Boom: How long you will last unless something changes
#Boom: How much you need to charge to not go bankrupt in the next x years

#recommendations: What can you change:
#                 1. Assign more accurate rate
#                 2. Explore your data to better understand your customers using shiny tool
#                 3. Eliminate Fraud 
#                 4. Set max number of policy changes, or max #days between a policy change
#                 5. Collect Data more dilligently: make sure addresses exist, require a doctor to fill out medical information
#                 6. Promote to certain demographics
#                 7. Set regulations on # of policies.  look at risk of persom with multple policies versus just one
